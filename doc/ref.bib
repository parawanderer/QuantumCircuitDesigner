  abstract  = {Quantum cryptography is arguably the fastest growing area in quantuminformation science. Novel theoretical protocols are designed on a regularbasis, security proofs are constantly improving, and experiments aregradually moving from proof-of-principle lab demonstrations to in-fieldimplementations and technological prototypes. In this paper, we provideboth a general introduction and a state-of-the-art description of therecent advances in the field, both theoretical and experimental. We startby reviewing protocols of quantum key distribution based on discretevariable systems. Next we consider aspects of device independence,satellite challenges, and protocols based on continuous-variable systems.We will then discuss the ultimate limits of point-to-point privatecommunications and how quantum repeaters and networks may overcome theserestrictions. Finally, we will discuss some aspects of quantumcryptography beyond standard quantum key distribution, including quantumrandom number generators and quantum digital signatures.},

These shortcomings arise from lack of clarity about which DH group parameters TLS servers should offer and clients should accept. This document offers a solution to these shortcomings for compatible peers by using a section of the TLS "Supported Groups Registry" (renamed from "EC Named Curve Registry" by this document) to establish common finite field DH parameters with known structure and a mechanism for peers to negotiate support for these groups. This document updates TLS versions 1.0 (RFC 2246), 1.1 (RFC 4346), and 1.2 (RFC 5246), as well as the TLS Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) extensions (RFC 4492).},

@article{ref:rsapaper,
  abstract   = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},
